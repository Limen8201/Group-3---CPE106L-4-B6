Use SQLite commands to complete the following exercises.


a) Create a table named ADVENTURE_TRIP. The table has the same structure as the TRIP table shown in Figure 3-2 below except the TRIP_NAME column should use the VARCHAR data type and the DISTANCE and MAX_GRP_SIZE columns should use the NUMBER data type. Execute the command to describe the layout and characteristics of the ADVENTURE_TRIP table.

b) Add the following row to the ADVENTURE_TRIP table: trip ID: 45; trip name: Jay Peak; start location: Jay; state: VT; distance: 8; maximum group size: 8; type: Hiking and sea- son: Summer. Display the contents of the ADVENTURE_TRIP table.

c) Delete the ADVENTURE_TRIP table.

d) Open the script file (SQLServerColonial.sql) to create the six tables and add records to the tables. Revise the script file so that it can be run in the DB Browser.

e) Confirm that you have created the tables correctly by describing each table and comparing the results to the figures shown below. Confirm that you have added all data correctly by viewing the data in each table and comparing the results to Figures 1-4 through 1-8 shown below.
